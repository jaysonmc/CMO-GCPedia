# CMO-GCPedia
This is the html that gets pased into the GcConnex env to create the CMO page

This project is a backup of the HTML required to run on an internal site.

It is vanilla HTML, as that is all the internal system permits. The code is not managed by a development team, 
and is developed collaboratively with internal teams who are familiaring themselves with foundational web technologies (HTML/CSS).
